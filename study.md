## Type Conversion

Write the Ruby code that takes the integer `700` and returns the string `"007"`.

```ruby
700.to_s.reverse
```

## Array Manipulation

Write the Ruby code that takes the following array, `[23, 56, 3, 7]`, and
manipulates it by sorting it and then reversing it in place (i.e., modifying the
reference to the original).

```ruby
[23, 56, 3, 7].sort!.reverse!
```

## Class#method!

What does an exclamation point after a method usually signify?  e.g.,
`my_string.capitalize!`

```md
It modifies the object that invoked method.
```

## Instantiation
How do you create an instance of a class in Ruby?

```ruby
my_instance = MyClass.new
```

## Class Modification

If a class in Ruby gets modified while there are existing instances of it, then
will those instances also have those modifications?

```md
Yes.
```

## Iteration

Write an example of iteration in Ruby.

```ruby
(1..10).each { |number| puts number }
```
